# Overview for the bike-sharing program in Des Moines

***The purpose for this study is analysis in below different ways to state the bike -sharing program is solid***
* Who use the bikeshare program by Gender ( Male/Female/ unkown), also known how long for the trips
* which time period are bikes used the most and least?
* Bike usage for each gender of people
* analyze the usage for each usertype of people (cutomer or subsciber)


## Results: 
* The result of 'Analysis of check out time for users'.

  The data shows that the average trip duration are within one hour. Most of the riders will not use a bike for more than one hour. Over 140K users use the rental bikes for more than 10 mins. After 10 min, the trend of riders start to decrease rapidely. 
* The ruslt of 'Analysis of check out time for gender'.

  The result shows that there are more male riders than female riders. There are also some unknow data, potentially because people may not be comfortable to provide personal detailed information to the public or people are in hurry and do not have time to provide such information.
* Trip by weekday for each hour

  The heatmap data imply that the busier time period are from 7 to 8AM and also from 5 to 6PM during the weekday, we can assume that people use the citi bike as an alternative transportaion. At noon time (11AM to 12PM) is also a busy period on Saturdays. We can also infer that since the peak hours is 7 to 8AM and 5 to6PM, these two time periods are most rush-hour commute for more commuters who are using cycling as a alternative transportaion from home to work and go home after work. Users tend show that longer, and more casual ride are during the weekend compared to weekdays. 
* User Trips by gender by weekday

  To compare gender, more male than female use the bike-sharing program.  Wednsday is lighter than other weekday for both male and female, lots of male commuters use the bike on Thursdays compared to other weekdays is a suprising finding.  
* User Trips by gender by weekday and also comparision of user type analysis

  The heatmap shows more user are subscribers and male. More male residents are using the bike as commute. On the other hand, citi bike customers are more often tourist and may not want to share their gender personal information, (unkown gneder) data. 
* Number of riders per hour analysis

  The result shows off peak hours are between 12AM~5AM, peak hour are between 7 to 8AM and also 5 to6PM. Compared the peak hours, more commuter would ride a bike after work. 
* Bike reparis

  The data shows higher usage presents as red color need more frequent to repair; lower usage bikes less repair present as 
  darker green color. 
## Summary: 

Through this Study, with 2,344,224 bike rides in August 2019, we can tell the bikeshare servie is popular in New York city. Esepcially in densely populated cities, traffic congestion is always a big concern for commuters during the morning and evening rush hour. This bike share program provides a good option for people who have short trips to work or place nearby. The result shows more male residents sign up for this bike-share program and also commuting by bike. Durring the weekend, people tend to enjoy longer casual ride, the most usage hours are from noon to evening 7PM. 

Below are the two additional analysis I would like to add on for future analysis. 

* visualize the most popular trips based on start station and stop station data. It also provide an idea to investors where to require additional bikes for users and where to set up loading docks, or place ads. 

* Also analyze rider performance by birth year (age) based on average trip distance (between start station to stop station). From this study, we can examine the distribution of the rider age group and also have more clear pattern to understand which area can provide different assistence for different groups of people.
